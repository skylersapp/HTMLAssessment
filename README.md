## Overview
* **HTML Assessment**

I will use HTML to design a very simple webpage based on the structure provided by Skill Distillery. I will demonstrate a functional understanding of basic HTML concepts to include coloring, hyperlinks, sizing, and more.

* **CSS Assessment**

I will use CSS to edit a page created with HTML. This page is provided by Skill Distillery with the "file write" privileges removed. I will demonstrate a functional understanding of basic CSS concepts to include font-families and styling, table creation, list editing, and more.

## Challenges

Having never before been exposed to any of the front-end languages before this program, I found the structure to be a little more "free-form" than what I was used to in Java. I have become accustomed to having Java tell me whether my code is going to work or not, and typically whether or not the code will produce my expected result. In HTML and in CSS, this isn't the case. I can type code that "feels" like it will work, but then my page doesn't display that way. There is a lot more trial and error with these languages, and while the freedom is nice, I did find it to be much more challenging. There was significantly more independent research of the languages required on my part to produce the desired results.


## Lessons Learned
These projects, more than any up to this point, have really highlighted for me the fact that this career will always be one of continuous learning and self-study. These languages are all used in slightly different ways with different syntax, and memorizing every one of each of their "rules" and never mixing anything up is simply not feasible. I'm seeing now that I will constantly be learning new (and re-learning old) concepts and implementations, and while that might seem daunting to some, is an exciting prospect to me.
